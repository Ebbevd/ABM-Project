Create a prospet theory block that takes media coverage and other nodes that have been floding and calculates a score that 
determines when they are adapted and when not

In the model add the number of zones, determine for each zone if there is a flood there yes, no. Than check for the agent if they are in the zone.
If in the flooded zone get the actual flood damage. 


added moving of agents when adapting and added a function that moves them to a heigher place making. Agents can also become unadapted when the estimated flood level becomes too high again in their area.
Also adding zones
