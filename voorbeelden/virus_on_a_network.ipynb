    "*In this assignment, you'll engage with this fun model to simulate virus propagation across various network topologies. You'll investigate how different network structures affect the transition rates among agent states: susceptible, infected, and resistant. As the simulation progresses, you'll observe emergent behaviors resulting from agent interactions and network configurations. You'll also introduce external scenarios and policy interventions into the model. This will allow you to examine how events like virus mutations or the discovery of a cure can alter the dynamics of the system. Additionally, you'll explore strategies that individual agents can adopt to mitigate infection risks.*"
